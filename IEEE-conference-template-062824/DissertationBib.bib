  abstract        = {Computer gaming addiction has been evolved as a detrimental form of addiction in yesteryears. the past researches show that internet and gaming addiction is as problematic as it takes a toll on one's mental and physical health. Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the key facets to determine one's physical health fitness since the last two centuries. Consequently, gaming and addiction and body mass index strike as being associated to each other. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the impact of computer gaming addiction (CGA) on the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person. The research methodology is based on a survey conducted in the Sukkur city of Pakistan where 300 respondents participated. To ensure the legitimacy of research, consensus based scaling was used and the responses were validated by performing Chi square test. The results indicated a significant impact of Computer gaming addiction (CGA) on the Body mass index (BMI) of an individual.},

This addiction is very harmful for our physical and mental health. So, this is going to be a very dangerous fact for our generation. It mainly influences our young generation. It can change our daily life. It hampers our study concentration, brain, health and we forget our social life for this addiction. Online game addicted people face lots of problems like headache, eye problem, eating problem, lack of sleep, losing mood easily etc. Nowadays, the collection of data via online is so difficult to do. When sending data collection forms to the friends, the relatives and others they feel uncomfortable sharing their personal information. So, we can't find any standard dataset for our research. Finally, we have decided to make our own dataset via collecting data from our friends, relatives and others. And we reserve our data in a systematic way, where the ML algorithm can classify our data in some categories. Therefore, the main purpose of this research study is to make sense about online game addiction and make a good structured and large data set for researchers which can help them to analyze the data and get applicable results from their research.},

Based on respondent data acquired through questionnaires, this study is analyzed using PLS-SEM with SmartPLS. This was accomplished through purposive sample of Mobile Legends players that actively play the game nearly every day (every day or every two days), have never purchased in-game stuff, and intend to purchase in-game things. Addiction has a big impact on loyalty, but not on purchase intention. Apart from perceived flexibility, almost all criteria in perceived value have a major impact on mobile game loyalty. Only perceived playfulness and loyalty to mobile games have an impact on purchase intention.},

  abstract        = {Internet gaming disorder, also known as video game addiction and pathological gaming, has officially been proposed as a psychiatric disorder. Numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of the disorder, but the prevalence rates that they arrive at vary in the extreme (from 0.6% to 44.5%). This discrepancy between studies inevitably raises questions about what they actually measure. To explore this further five young men who were candidates for this new diagnosis where asked to fill out a questionnaire probing pathological gaming and interviewed about how they understood the questions and their thoughts on video game addiction in general. Thus, this paper presents the results of a qualitative investigation of the face-validity of quantitative research on video game addiction. The interviews showed that the respondents often misunderstood the intention of the questions, misjudged the severity of the negative effects that the questions probed and often interpreted the questions very differently. Only one of the respondents believed pathological gaming to be a primary disorder, but he also believed it to promote more positive than negative effects. The rest of the respondent either did not believe in the disorder at all or believed it to be secondary to other problems, such as anxiety or depression.},

However, the predictive factors that make some individuals more at risk for game addiction are not well recognised. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether levels of attention, emotional responses, perceived immersion, and specific brain activities might be associated with the development of game addiction. A total of thirty-six participants were separated into two different groups based on high or low vulnerability to game addiction. During the experiment, frontal EEG signals were acquired while the participants were playing VR game and while other relevant behavioural tasks were completed. Results showed that the high vulnerability group had faster reaction time in pre- and post- gaming flanker tasks and a lower absolute beta power in comparison to the low vulnerability group. The current study accentuates the significance for future investigations on constructing complete pictures of game addiction and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of game addiction. Limitations and future implications of the study were also discussed.},

We admit that it is possible to label the phenomenon as overuse or excessive use as long as it is defined and measured by the presence and the magnitude of the six core symptoms of behavioral addictions: salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. The advantage of this terminology is that it does not attribute one's problems to helplessness and does not pathologize the behavior, implying that it may possibly be corrected. Nevertheless, we posit that the term technology addiction is currently the most reasonable choice that may need to be adjusted as we learn more about this phenomenon and its potential similarities to and differences from established behavioral addictions. Dependence, obsessive/compulsive use, and pathological/problem use terms should not be used as synonyms for technology addiction as a form of mental disorder. Researchers should not include the name of the IT artifact as the subject of addiction (e.g., "Facebook addiction"). Instead, they should focus on the activity that is mediated through the IT artifact (e.g., "addiction to Facebook use").},

The number of people who play and become potentially obsessed with them has also increased. This is due to the fact of internet availability and increasing bandwidth over the years. The recently imposed lockdowns have also multiplied the outcomes. The objective of the research is to study the physical, behavioral effects and psychosocial influences caused by obsession with Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and also to suggest solutions to decrease their negative influence. The quantitative method has been used to collect and examine the data for this study. The questions are shared on popular online role-playing game communities and the data is acquired from them. Incentives were given to the participants of this study and their consent was obtained while also maintaining their privacy. The findings show that not all players tend to develop an obsession, but for a good percentage of users, online games can hurt their personal and social lives. The findings reveal the type of people vulnerable to online game obsession besides other causes. The results show conclusive evidence of obsession developed through online role-playing games. The conclusion of this research interprets the connotation between online role-playing games and social health. The major highlight of this study is that it investigates and understands the characteristics of obsessed gamers. To the readers, this article provides insights on regulating the time spent on online games to overcome an unhealthy and distracted life.},

Past research has showed that gamified map-based apps and location-based games (LBGs) have the capability to incentivize people to go to nature areas in cities and beyond. In this study, we explored LBGs' potential to bring people to nature by conducting a field experiment with a new mechanic called Routes in the popular LBG Pokémon GO. Prior to the Route feature's launch, we created altogether 13 Routes of various lengths in both city and nature landscapes. We collected numerical in-game data of how many times each Route was walked and deployed a survey (n=67) for Pokémon GO players in the area where the Routes were made. The findings suggest that proximity to population concentrations and in-game rewards are key drivers of Route popularity. Players' motivators to choose nature Routes over urban Routes were limited to outside-the-game factors such as scenery, and overall in our experiment the urban Routes turned out to be more popular.},

  abstract  = {Over the last decade, the free-to-play (F2P) game business model has gained popularity in the games industry. We examine the role of deceptive design during a game's transition to F2P and its impacts on players. Our analysis focuses on game mechanics and a Reddit analysis of the Overwatch (OW) series after it transitioned to an F2P model. Our study identifies nine game mechanics that use deceptive design patterns. We also identify factors contributing to a negative gameplay experience. Business model transitions in games present possibilities for problematic practices. Our findings identify the need for game developers and publishers to balance player investments and fairness of rewards. A game's successful transition depends on maintaining fundamental components of player motivation and ensuring transparent communication. Compared to existing taxonomies in other media, games need a comprehensive classification of deceptive design. We emphasize the importance of understanding player perceptions and the impact of deceptive practices in future research.},

The eye-gaze interactions are partially based on eye exercises reducing digital eye strain but also on employing peripheral vision. By employing eye-gaze as a necessary input mechanism, we explore the effects on and tradeoffs between user enjoyment and digital eye strain in a five-day longitudinal between-subject study (N=17) compared to interaction with a traditional mouse. We found that perceived competence was significantly higher with eye gaze interaction and significantly higher internal eye strain. With this work, we contribute to the not straightforward inclusion of eye tracking as a useful and fun input method for games.},

The success of games requires them to have appealing gaming interfaces, optimal player interactions, and engaging playability characteristics. Therefore, analysis of a game player's engagement in any game is important to determine the effectiveness of any game. This study presents an electroencephalography (EEG) based player engagement classification model by utilizing MUSE Headband. EEG data were acquired from 31 players while playing three (Tetris, Subway Surfer, Smash Hit) games. A questionnaire was filled out to label the acquired data for supervised classification. Data was labeled into three classes (bored, engaged, and excited) based on a score of questionnaires. Two classifiers support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron were used to identify the engagement level of players and accuracy of 86.2% and 80.4% were achieved respectively. A comparative analysis of current methodology with the previous research techniques depict that currently proposed methodology is more effective in terms of level of classification accuracy, robustness and flexibility due to its applicability on variety of games. This shows the potential of our system to be used in in-game engagement analysis for a better player experience and thereby the success of the game in the market.},

Arithmatopia is a serious education game to help elementary school students improve arithmetic skills with the gamification of number bonds to 10 method proposed by Rowland (2008) with three gameplay modes single player, competitive multiplayer, and cooperative-competitive multiplayer. Game refinement theory is a theory introduced by Iida (2004) about the uncertainty of game results that can be used to measure player engagement. Game refinement theory is used to get the value of refinement to compare three gameplay modes single player, competitive multiplayer, and cooperative-competitive multiplayer in Arithmatopia. The results show that cooperative-competitive multiplayer mode is the mode that can create the highest player engagement in Arithmatopia with the highest average refinement value of 0.095 ± 0.02 in 3 games, followed by competitive multiplayer mode of 0.085 ± 0.013 in 3 games and the lowest is the single player mode of 0.082 ± 0.004 in 3 games. The results obtained have proved and supported quantitative statements in the results of previous qualitative research on multiplayer gameplay which is better for creating high player engagement compared to single player gameplay in games.},

  abstract        = {Microtransactions are small financial transactions that involve the purchase of virtual goods or services within a digital platform, such as mobile and online games, social media apps or digital content marketplaces. In today’s digital economy they have become a prevalent revenue model in gaming industry, allowing developers and publishers to generate income from their products beyond the initial purchase price. In free-to-play games and apps microtransactions have become a primary source of revenue for many developers. For players they can be used as an option to customize their experience or progress faster in a game, enhancing engagement by offering a more personalized and rewarding gaming experience. And in some games, spending money on microtransactions can provide a significant advantage over non-paying players, creating a "pay-to-win" environment. This is often criticized as unfair and can lead to frustration among those who prefer not to spend money on ingame items. The research seeks to examine the relevance of microtransactions on player success. By analyzing 800 profiles of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players on the Steam platform, the study examines the trends between playtime and the value of players’ inventories as independent variables in relation to the rank and proficiency that a players have achieved throughout their gaming journey.},

However, it is presently unclear how winning or losing might influence players’ engagement. We hypothesized that users in a competitive game will increase their level of engagement when they are losing. To test this hypothesis, we created a game in virtual reality in which each user competed against a virtual opponent that was programmed to either underperform, tie with, or overperform the user. We conducted a series of experiments on 72 volunteers who played four rounds of the game, with three rounds against each of the potential virtual opponents and one round alone. We found that user engagement increased when the virtual opponent outperformed the user, compared to when they played alone. A similar increase in user engagement was not registered when the user played against an underperforming or equally performing virtual opponent. To further elucidate the effect of the virtual opponent on user engagement, we applied the information-theoretic notion of transfer entropy, which offers a model-free approach for the inference of causal relationships between dynamical systems. Our findings provide insight into technology-mediated competition and its impact on engagement, thereby opening the door for targeted system interventions to modulate human response.},

In this paper, we present preliminary research examining the engaging aspects of idle game design in the form of two studies: 1) is a semi-structured group interview with idle game players, and 2) a $2 \times 2$ (idle game vs. casual game $\times$ PC vs. mobile) experimental diary study. Findings revealed that idle games are as engaging as casual games since there was no statistically significant difference in engagement and gameplay time. We also define key characteristics of favored idle games, highlighting notable gameplay patterns within idle games and exploring players’ motivation. Overall, this paper provides game designers and researchers with a more nuanced understanding of idle games, their relationship to casual games, and how they can be designed for more effective engagement across PC and mobile platforms.},

A mobile game developed during the study, Between Beats, was used to survey the influence of interstitial advertisement on selected aspects of player experience. The study was conducted by deploying the game to Google Play and guiding the players, after gameplay, to an online survey. The survey was answered by 51 participants who were divided randomly into four groups based on how much they were subjected to interstitial or rewarded advertisements while playing. Our results show that embedding rewarded advertisements to a situation where there already is interstitial advertisements, resulted in reduction of perceived advertisement intrusiveness and increase in advertisements viewed. Player engagement remained constant in all groups. Our findings complement earlier findings on the use of rewarded advertisements in mobile games.},

  abstract  = {Role-playing games (RPGs) are one of the most exciting and most rapidly expanding genres of online games. Virtual characters that are not controlled by players, have become an integral part, which helps to advance narratives of RPGs. Believable characters can enhance game engagement and further improve player retention. However, game players easily find that most characters' behaviors are limited and improbable, resulting in a less meaningful game experience. In this work, we propose a framework to model game behaviors to learn behavior patterns of human players. Based on the learned behavior patterns, it generates human-like action sequences that can be used for the design of believable virtual characters in RPGs, so as to enhance game engagement. Specifically, considering the influence of game context in behavior patterns, we integrate game context (players' levels and game classes) with actions together to model behaviors. We propose a long-term memory cell on actions and game context to learn the hidden representations. We also introduce an attention mechanism to measure the contribution of the actions previously performed to the next action. Given only one action, our model can generate action sequences by predicting the succeeding action based on the previously generated actions. The model was evaluated on a real-world data set of over 22 000 players and more than 51 million action logs of an RPG game in 21 days. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {Online gaming has grown to be a very popular electronic entertainment for people throughout the world.
However, the burgeoning popularity of online games in some cases leads to addiction, a phenomenon that has
received considerable attention. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of psychological ownership,
gaming motivation, and primary–secondary control on online game addiction (OGA). Based on 436 valid re
sponses collected from online questionnaires, the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach
was employed to test the research model. Findings show that the motivations of achievement and escapism are
positively associated with psychological ownership toward a virtual gaming environment. Of particular interest
is the inverted-U relationship between psychological ownership and OGA, suggesting that too little or too much
psychological ownership is associated with less OGA. Finally, individuals with high levels of primary (secondary)
control are more (less) inclined to be addicted to online games.
This study provides practical implications and strategies to address the alarming increase in OGA. First,
families, communities, and universities should encourage outdoor activities, such as sports competitions, and
offline cosplay games to address the need for achievement and escapism. Second, individuals who play online
games for relaxation should choose a relatively easy or hard mode to avoid game addiction. Finally, parents,
teachers, and employers are encouraged to pay attention to individuals who have a high level of primary control
since they can be susceptible to OGA. This study provides several theoretical contributions. First, the study
enriches OGA and the gaming motivation literature by exploring the roles of gaming motivation, psychological
ownership, and personal control strategies as they can be a factor in OGA. In addition, this study is the first to
investigate the dark side of psychological ownership in terms of negative outcomes for OGA. This study also
advances the personal control strategy literature by understanding the roles of primary and secondary control on
OGA.},

  abstract        = {A recent research result reports that the use of electronic devices is one of the factors affecting sleep. Polysomnography, in which EEG (Electroencephalogram), heart rates, and so on are measured, is often used to measure the state of sleep. Polysomnography burdens subjects because electrodes need to be attached to their heads and chests all night long. On the other hand, wearable devices have recently become popular as small and lightweight measurement devices worn on the body due to electronic circuit downsizing. A typical example is a wrist-watch type device, which can measure heart rates and sleep status just by being worn on the wrist. This study aims to clarify the effect of using electronic devices before bedtime on the quality of sleep through experiments. The sleep state of the subjects was measured by using a wearable device in the experiments. The measured results are compared based on the three kinds of tasks to the subject in pre-sleep time: regular books, electronic books (e-books), and electronic games (e-games). The results of statistical analysis for the measured data have shown that e-books and e-games increased the time to fall asleep and decreased sleep efficiency compared to reading regular books.},

  abstract        = {Inspired from the green revolution in IT industry where measures are being taken to reduce the CO2 emission. This s being down by proposing various new hardware design which consume less power, also it is being taken care that the device used should not get heated up very soon or to very high temperature where again cooling is required which again add to CO2 emission. Here we proposed another way through which IT industry can serve the environment by reducing the power consumption of the computer system. This is the area where none of the researcher has thought-off. We tried to propose the use of programming language to provide IT solution based on the complexity of the algorithms used, which in turn helps to consume less power by the CPU. Here we have chosen three high-level programming languages (C++, C#, and JAVA) to compare the power consumed by algorithms of various complexities using the chosen languages. This may help our IT industry to choose programming language which consumes less power. This may help our IT Industries to Go Green},
